            <h2>Elements Reference - El Filibusterismo: Relevance and Reflection</h2>

            <div class="section">
                <p class="question">1. How are the themes of social injustice, political corruption, and the struggle for freedom explored in El Filibusterismo still relevant today?</p>
                <p>El Filibusterismo portrays social injustice through the oppression of Filipinos by Spanish authorities and friars, mirroring modern issues such as human rights violations, poverty, and abuse of power. Political corruption is evident in how government officials and religious leaders exploit their power for personal gain—similar to present-day corruption scandals. The struggle for freedom is embodied in Simoun’s rebellion, reflecting ongoing movements for democracy, equality, and social justice worldwide.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <p class="question">2. Analyze the novel's enduring message about the importance of education, social reform, and the pursuit of true freedom.</p>
                <p>Rizal emphasizes education as a tool for enlightenment and resistance, shown through Basilio’s dedication to studying despite hardships. This message remains relevant as education empowers people to challenge ignorance and oppression. Social reform is depicted through characters like Isagani, advocating for positive change rather than violent revolution, reinforcing the idea that meaningful progress comes through systemic reforms. The pursuit of true freedom is questioned—Simoun’s violent approach fails, suggesting that genuine freedom is achieved through knowledge, unity, and moral leadership.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <p class="question">3. Discuss how the novel can inspire critical thinking and social action in contemporary society.</p>
                <p>El Filibusterismo encourages readers to question authority, resist oppression, and seek justice. It inspires critical thinking by showing how blind obedience and inaction allow corruption to thrive. The novel urges individuals to actively participate in social change, whether through education, activism, or civic engagement. In modern times, it serves as a call to action against systemic issues, urging society to work towards a just and equitable future.</p>

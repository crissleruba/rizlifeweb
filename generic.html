									<h1>RIZAL WORKS:<br/> MASTERPIECES THAT SHAPED A NATION</h1>
									<p>Through his cultural and educational experiences, Rizal demonstrated to the<br />
										Filipino people and the rest of the world what a nation deserves and how to<br />
										address inequity.</p>

								<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8">Novels</h1>
							
								<p class="mt-3"><span class="font-bold">Noli Me Tangere (1887)</span> - Starting with Jose Rizal's first novel, this novel written in Spanish, discusses unfair practices in the law and in society, discrimination against native Filipinos, the shortcomings in the colonial administrative system in the late 19th century, and the treatment of the residents by the ruling government and Spanish Catholic friars.</p>
								<p class="mt-3"> The story of Noli Me Tangere focuses on Crisóstomo Ibarra, a young, ambitious Filipino who returned to the Philippines after studying in Europe. Upon his arrival, he seeks to bring positive changes to his country by strengthening education. However, he quickly learns the severe corruption and abuses of Spanish friars and government officials. Ibarra's father, Don Rafael Ibarra, was falsely accused of infidelity and died in prison while under the control of Padre Damaso, a prominent and unethical priest. Determined to carry on his father's legacy, Ibarra intends to create an educational institution to educate Filipinos, thinking that knowledge leads the way toward change.</p>
								<p class="mt-3"> Recognizing that María Clara is in fact Padre Damaso's illegitimate daughter complicates his love for the lovely and faithful woman. María Clara struggles with balancing her responsibilities to the church with her love for Ibarra. Ibarra gains more knowledge about the injustices that the people face with the support of Elias, a mystery revolutionary. However, he gets accused of rebellion and nearly killed because of a plot against him. With Elias' assistance, Ibarra manages to escape after María Clara is compelled to enter a convent, but he is believed to be dead.</p>

										RIZAL WORKS:<br/> EL FILIBUSTERISMO
									</h1>  
								</header>
								<div class="image page1"><img src="gomburza.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p class="mt-3"><span class="font-bold">El Filibusterismo (1891)</span>- Rizal's second novel, commonly known as The Reign of Greed in English, revolves upon the main character of the Noli-El Fili duology, Crisóstomo Ibarra, who has returned for revenge as "Simoun". The novel's dark theme contrasts sharply with the previous novel's optimistic and passionate atmosphere, symbolizing Ibarra's resort to using violence to solve his country's problems after his previous attempts to reform the country's system failed and appeared impossible considering the Spaniards' corrupt perception of Filipinos. </p>
								<p class="mt-3">While Noli Me Tangere has a romantic and sweet state, El Filibusterismo is the sequel. In the previous novel, Crisóstomo Ibarra, a reform-minded mestizo who wanted to open an educational institution in his hometown of San Diego and marry his childhood sweetheart, was wrongly accused of rebellion and assumed dead after escaping from prison in a gunfight. Thirteen years after the events of Noli Me Tangere, Crisóstomo Ibarra returns as Simoun, a wealthy and mysterious jeweler.</p>
								<p class="mt-3">He controls corrupt officials and high-profile individuals in order to cause chaos and encourage rebellion among the oppressed Filipinos. His ultimate plot involves a bomb buried in a lamp at a wedding celebration, which is intended to start an uprising. However, Basilio, a young scholar who had suffered at the hands of the friars, discovers the plot and notifies Isagani, the bride's boyfriend, Paulita Gómez. At the last moment, Isagani throws the lamp into the river, avoiding the explosion.</p>
								<p class="mt-3">Simoun, who is now a fugitive, takes protection with Padre Florentino, who is a devoted priest. Severely pained and beaten he admits his misdeeds and shortcomings, complaining how his wrath resulted in nothing but pain. Before dying, he tosses his remaining possessions into the sea, signifying his lost ambition for independence.</p>

								<!-- First Poem - Mi Último Adiós -->
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/mi-ultimo-adios.jpg" alt="Mi Último Adiós Manuscript" /></div>
						
								<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8">POEMS</h1>
						
								<p class="mt-3"><span class="font-bold">Mi Último Adiós (1896)</span> – Jose Rizal also wrote some poems, including <i>‘Mi Último Adiós’</i>, which means ‘My Last Farewell’ in English. The piece was one of the last notes he created before being executed by the firing squad on December 30, 1896. Another note he had written was discovered in his shoe, but although the wording was unreadable, the details are unidentified.</p>
						
								<p class="mt-3">
									The poem is about expressing his deep devotion for the Philippines and his willingness to give his life as a sacrifice for the freedom of his nation. In the poem, he bids farewell to his homeland, accepts his fate bravely, and believes that his heroism will encourage generations to come and carry on the fight for independence. He appreciates the lovely qualities of the Philippines, the misery of its people, and the persecution under Spanish rule, but stays optimistic about a brighter future.

								<!-- Second Poem - A La Juventud Filipina -->
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/A_La_Juventud_Filipina.jpg" alt="A La Juventud Filipina Cover" /></div>
						
								<p class="mt-3"><span class="font-bold">A La Juventud Filipina (1879)</span></p>
						
								<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
									Also known as *"To the Philippine Youth"*, this Spanish-language poem was composed by Filipino writer and patriot José Rizal and first presented in Manila in 1879 while he was a student at the University of Santo Tomás. Rizal wrote *A la Juventud Filipina* at the age of 18 and dedicated it to the Filipino youth, whom he characterizes as *"The bright future of my Nation."*
								</p>
						
								<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
									Rizal opens the poem by addressing Filipino youth as the hopeful future of the country, asking them to use their abilities, knowledge, and strength to help the country. He emphasizes the importance of education and art in determining the future of the nation, highlighting that Filipinos possess the potential for greatness and should not regard themselves as being below the colonists.
								</p>
						
								<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
									*A La Juventud Filipina* is an uplifting poem that asserts that Filipino youngsters are capable of great accomplishments. It encourages Filipino youth to realize their full potential by applying their abilities and knowledge for the advancement of the country. It inspires the youth to liberate Filipinos from poverty and pursue independence and respect for humanity.
								</p>
						
								<!-- Third Poem - El Canto del Viajero -->
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/El_Canto_del_Viajero.jpg" alt="El Canto del Viajero Cover" /></div>
						
								<p class="mt-3"><span class="font-bold">El Canto del Viajero (1895)</span></p>
						
								<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
									Rizal had offered his services as a doctor in the military in Cuba, during the time there was an undergoing revolution and a major yellow fever outbreak, months before the Katipunan approached him. There was a medical shortage to meet the needs of the Spanish forces and Cubans. Blumentritt informed him about the appalling health conditions in the war-torn country. In accordance to Blumentritt's advice, on December 17, 1895, Rizal responded to Governor General Ramon Blanco, Despojul's successor, offering his services as a military doctor in Cuba. Malacañang did not respond to his request after months of waiting and gave up believing that his compassionate offer would ever be approved by the authorities.
								</p>
						
								<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
									The poem by José Rizal expresses his sentiments of feeling alone, yearning, and restlessness as he travels far from home. The poem expresses the sentiments of a wanderer who is continually moving from place to place, never actually finding a place to call home, in search of meaning and fulfillment. Rizal shows a strong desire for his country, the Philippines, but yet recognizes that his destiny forces him to continue traveling. He recalls his admiration of the different places he has been, yet he stays emotionally distant, feeling like a tourist with no true home to settle.
								</p>
						
								<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
									Lastly, *El Canto del Viajero* emphasizes the hardships made by individuals who leave their hometown to pursue a higher purpose, reflecting Rizal's personal journey as a nationalist, liberal, and exile.

									<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
										Rizal challenged Spanish claims about Filipino laziness through his argument that continual Spanish oppression had stripped Filipinos of intellectual pursuits and economic advancement, thus blocking their growth as a nation. According to Rizal, Filipino laziness developed because of how the colonizers controlled their society.
									</p>
							
									<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
										According to Rizal, Filipino society demonstrated industrious behavior through trade activities and agricultural involvement, as well as skilled craftsmanship during pre-Spanish times. The Spanish regime implemented <b>polo y servicios</b> alongside excessive taxation and land seizure to force Filipino people into servitude, thus diminishing their productive capability. Spanish officials and friars who mistreated Filipino workers contributed to diminishing local people's willingness to work.
									</p>
							
									<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
										The piece examined how both the education system and religious institutions helped create ignorance within Philippine society. Rizal criticized Spain's insufficient educational institutions and its restrictive book policies and church control of knowledge because these measures stopped Filipino intellectual and economic advancement. According to his belief, the Filipino people would not achieve prosperity unless they received proper education alongside access to opportunities.
									</p>
							
									<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
										Rizal maintained that Filipinos faced no laziness warranting blame but instead needed reforms from Spanish authorities to enhance their power. He pushed for improved education together with enhanced industrial agriculture and humane Filipino treatment. Rizal demonstrated in this piece that Filipino "indolence" stemmed from historical oppression, showing the need for transformation and justice, revealing the misconception about Filipino racial characteristics.

									<p class="mt-3"><span class="font-bold">Annotations of Antonio de Morga’s *Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas*</span></p>
							
									<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
										José Rizal accurately restated Antonio de Morga’s *Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas* by adding scholarly commentary to correct factual errors made by Spanish colonizers. 
										Jose Rizal examined each detail in Morga's *Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas* from 1609 because it documented Spanish Philippines during the first Spanish period. 
										Rizal added annotations to Morga’s work that demonstrated the pre-colonial Philippines had a developed system of culture, governance, and economy before the arrival of Spanish colonizers.
									</p>
							
									<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
										Through his analysis, Rizal disproved Spanish claims that prior to colonization Filipinos had no civilization. 
										The initial Filipinos developed complete settings for trade, as well as agricultural methods and governance systems that thrived independently. 
										Through his research, he showed how Spanish colonial policies harmed native industries, modified traditional practices, and enforced external control, 
										which blocked the Philippines from achieving normal development. 
										His writings had two functions: restoring Filipino pride about their heritage as well as encouraging Filipinos to recover their past identity and national history.
									</p>
							
									<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
										The annotations of Rizal identified how colonial oppression affected the development of Filipino society. 
										Spanish policies, which included *polo y servicios* along with excessive governance, caused the suffering of the people instead of fostering their development. 
										Rizal intended to notify Filipino nationalism while stimulating intellectual discussions about the future of the country by revealing these unfair practices.
									</p>
							
									<p class="mt-3 text-lg">
										Through his notes in Morga's work, Rizal established a primary appeal for Filipinos to both remember their history and govern themselves. 
										Rizal wanted Filipino people to understand their abundant cultural legacy and fight against foreign colonial mentalities that prevailed in their society. 
										His annotations continue to be a major early work in Philippine historiography by highlighting the necessity of truth for comprehending national history and forging its pathway ahead.

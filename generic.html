									<h1>RIZAL'S LEGACY:<br/>
									MASTERPIECES THAT SHAPED A NATION</h1>
									<p>Through his cultural and educational experiences, Rizal demonstrated to the<br />
										Filipino people and the rest of the world what a nation deserves and how to<br />
										address inequity.</p>
								</header>

								<h1>Novels</h1>
								<p>Noli Me Tangere (1887) - Starting with Jose Rizal's first novel, this novel written in Spanish, discusses unfair practices in the law and in society, discrimination against native Filipinos, the shortcomings in the colonial administrative system in the late 19th century, and the treatment of the residents by the ruling government and Spanish Catholic friars.</p>
								<p> The story of Noli Me Tangere focuses on Crisóstomo Ibarra, a young, ambitious Filipino who returned to the Philippines after studying in Europe. Upon his arrival, he seeks to bring positive changes to his country by strengthening education. However, he quickly learns the severe corruption and abuses of Spanish friars and government officials. Ibarra's father, Don Rafael Ibarra, was falsely accused of infidelity and died in prison while under the control of Padre Damaso, a prominent and unethical priest. Determined to carry on his father's legacy, Ibarra intends to create an educational institution to educate Filipinos, thinking that knowledge leads the way toward change.</p>
								<p> Recognizing that María Clara is in fact Padre Damaso's illegitimate daughter complicates his love for the lovely and faithful woman. María Clara struggles with balancing her responsibilities to the church with her love for Ibarra. Ibarra gains more knowledge about the injustices that the people face with the support of Elias, a mystery revolutionary. However, he gets accused of rebellion and nearly killed because of a plot against him. With Elias' assistance, Ibarra manages to escape after María Clara is compelled to enter a convent, but he is believed to be dead.</p>

							<p>El Filibusterismo (1891) - Rizal's second novel, commonly known as The Reign of Greed in English, revolves upon the main character of the Noli-El Fili duology, Crisóstomo Ibarra, who has returned for revenge as "Simoun". The novel's dark theme contrasts sharply with the previous novel's optimistic and passionate atmosphere, symbolizing Ibarra's resort to using violence to solve his country's problems after his previous attempts to reform the country's system failed and appeared impossible considering the Spaniards' corrupt perception of Filipinos. </p>
							<p>While Noli Me Tangere has a romantic and sweet state, El Filibusterismo is the sequel. In the previous novel, Crisóstomo Ibarra, a reform-minded mestizo who wanted to open an educational institution in his hometown of San Diego and marry his childhood sweetheart, was wrongly accused of rebellion and assumed dead after escaping from prison in a gunfight. Thirteen years after the events of Noli Me Tangere, Crisóstomo Ibarra returns as Simoun, a wealthy and mysterious jeweler.</p>
						    <p>He controls corrupt officials and high-profile individuals in order to cause chaos and encourage rebellion among the oppressed Filipinos. His ultimate plot involves a bomb buried in a lamp at a wedding celebration, which is intended to start an uprising. However, Basilio, a young scholar who had suffered at the hands of the friars, discovers the plot and notifies Isagani, the bride's boyfriend, Paulita Gómez. At the last moment, Isagani throws the lamp into the river, avoiding the explosion.</p>
				            <p>Simoun, who is now a fugitive, takes protection with Padre Florentino, who is a devoted priest. Severely pained and beaten he admits his misdeeds and shortcomings, complaining how his wrath resulted in nothing but pain. Before dying, he tosses his remaining possessions into the sea, signifying his lost ambition for independence.</p>

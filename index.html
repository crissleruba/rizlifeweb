									El Filibusterismo (The Reign of Greed) is the sequel to Noli Me Tangere, written by José Rizal and published in 1891.
								    Unlike Noli Me Tangere, which focuses on exposing Spanish abuses with a sense of hope, El Filibusterismo has a darker 
									and more serious tone. The novel follows Simoun, a wealthy jeweler who is actually Crisóstomo Ibarra in disguise. After 
									experiencing betrayal and injustice, Simoun seeks revenge and plans a revolution to overthrow Spanish rule. The novel explores 
									themes of oppression, corruption, and the dangers of seeking justice through violence. El Filibusterismo played an important role 
									in inspiring Filipinos to fight for freedom and independence.

									José Rizal (June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896) was a Filipino patriot, writer, and physician whose works and actions inspired the Philippine nationalist movement.
                                    Born in Calamba, Laguna, Rizal came from a well-off family. He received his early education in Manila and later studied at the University of Madrid, where he excelled in medicine. While studying in Europe between 1882 and 1892, he became deeply committed to advocating reforms under Spanish rule in the Philippines. However, he did not openly call for independence at that time.
                                    Rizal was a talented writer, and his most famous works were the novels Noli Me Tangere (1887), and El Filibusterismo (1891). These books exposed the injustices and abuses of Spanish colonial rule. He also published an annotated edition of Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas by Antonio Morga in 1890, proving that Filipinos had a rich history before Spanish colonization. Rizal actively contributed to La Solidaridad, the newspaper of the Propaganda Movement, which called for reforms such as Philippine representation in the Spanish Cortes, freedom of speech, and equal rights for Filipinos.
                                    Upon returning to the Philippines in 1892, Rizal founded La Liga Filipina, a peaceful reform group. However, the Spanish authorities saw him as a threat and exiled him to Dapitan in Mindanao, where he lived for four years. In 1896, the Katipunan, a secret revolutionary society, launched a revolt against Spain. Although Rizal was not involved in the uprising, he was arrested and accused of rebellion. After a military trial, he was sentenced to death. On December 30, 1896, he was executed by a Spanish firing squad in Manila.
                                    Rizal’s death strengthened the Filipinos' desire for independence. On the night before his execution, he wrote Mi Último Adiós (My Last Farewell), a poem that reflected his love for his country.</i>.

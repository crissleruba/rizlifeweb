                                    <p>Simoun is a wealthy jeweler and a close adviser to the captain-general. Though feared for his cruelty, the elite seek his favor, unaware that he is actually Crisóstomo Ibarra in disguise. Having faked his death and spent years in exile, he returns with a hidden agenda: to seek revenge and ignite a revolution.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Using his influence, Simoun fuels both oppression and resistance, pushing the country toward rebellion. Though he longs to rescue María Clara, his plans are ruthless, believing that only through bloodshed can the Philippines be reborn.</p>

                                            <p>A passionate student and poet, Isagani fights for education reform and national pride. As Father Florentino’s nephew, he believes in open advocacy, even when secrecy might be safer. His engagement to Paulita Gómez ends due to their differing values, leaving him heartbroken but resolute.</p>

                                            <p>Though betrayed, Isagani's noble character prevails—he risks his life to stop a deadly bombing at Paulita’s wedding, saving oppressors he despises. After his release from prison, he chooses a quiet life in the countryside, disillusioned but steadfast in his ideals.</p>

                                            <p>Basilio, a determined medical student, overcame childhood tragedy to pursue a future of healing. Supported by Captain Tiago, he dreams of marrying Julí and serving the poor as a doctor. Though aware of colonial oppression, he initially believes education—not revolution—is the key to change.</p>
                                        
                                            <p>After his wrongful imprisonment and Julí’s tragic death, Basilio loses faith in justice and finally joins Simoun’s cause for revenge. Yet, his conscience prevails—by warning Isagani of a bomb, he unintentionally foils Simoun’s plan, proving that even in despair, his heart remains noble.</p>

                                            <p>A self-important Manila journalist, Ben Zayb believes himself a fearless writer, though he never truly challenges colonial rule.

                                            <p>Despite his inflated ego, Ben Zayb often fails to impress. His attempt to expose the illusion behind Mister Leeds’s talking head ends in public embarrassment, proving that his confidence outweighs his abilities.</p>

Though he enables Captain Tiago’s opium addiction, he later ensures Basilio’s inheritance—a rare act of kindness.</p>
                                        
                                            <p>Despite his position, Irene’s behavior is often unseemly. He embarrasses himself at the operetta by fawning over dancers, revealing his hypocrisy as both a religious leader and a supposed moral authority.</p>
